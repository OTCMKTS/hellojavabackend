// ## Synchronization mechanism for safe parallel access design notes
//
// The state of the StackRecorder is managed using a set of locks to avoid concurrency issues.
//
// This is needed because the state is expected to be accessed, in parallel, by two different threads.
//
// 1. The thread that is taking a stack sample and that called `record_sample`, let's call it the **sampler thread**.
// In the current implementation of the profiler, there can only exist one **sampler thread** at a time; if this
// constraint changes, we should revise the design of the StackRecorder.
//
// 2. The thread that serializes and reports profiles, let's call it the **serializer thread**. We enforce that there
// cannot be more than one thread attempting to serialize profiles at a time.
//
// If both the sampler and serializer threads are trying to access the same `ddog_prof_Profile` in parallel, we will
// have a concurrency issue. Thus, the StackRecorder has an added mechanism to avoid this.
//
// As an additional constraint, the **sampler thread** has absolute priority and must never block while
// recording a sample.
//
// ### The solution: Keep two profiles at the same time
//
// To solve for the constraints above, the StackRecorder keeps two `ddog_prof_Profile` profile instances inside itself.
// They are called the `slot_one_profile` and `slot_two_profile`.
//
// Each profile is paired with its own mutex. `slot_one_profile` is protected by `slot_one_mutex` and `slot_two_profile`
// is protected by `slot_two_mutex`.
//
// We additionally introduce the concept of **active** and **inactive** profile slots. At any point, the sampler thread
// can probe the mutexes to discover which of the profiles corresponds to the active slot, and then records samples in it.
// When the serializer thread is ready to serialize data, it flips the active and inactive slots; it reports the data
// on the previously-active profile slot, and the sampler thread can continue to record in the previously-inactive
// profile slot.
//
// Thus, the sampler and serializer threads never cross paths, avoiding concurrency issues. The sampler thread writes to
// the active profile slot, and the serializer thread reads from the inactive profile slot.
//
// ### Locking protocol, high-level
//
// The active profile slot is the slot for which its corresponding mutex **is unlocked**. That is, if the sampler
// thread can grab a lock for a profile slot, then that slot is the active one. (Here you see where the constraint
// stated above that only one sampler thread can exist kicks in -- this part would need to be more complex if multiple
// sampler threads were in play.)
//
// As a counterpart, the inactive profile slot mutex is **kept locked** until such time the serializer
// thread is ready to work and decides to flip the slots.
//
// When a new StackRecorder is initialized, the `slot_one_mutex` is unlocked, and the `slot_two_mutex` is kept locked,
// that is, a new instance always starts with slot one active.
//
// Additionally, an `active_slot`
